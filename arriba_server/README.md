## Installation & Setup
*Having errors with a fresh Angel installation? See [here](https://angel-dart.gitbook.io/angel/the-basics/installation) for help.*

Once you have [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) installed, bootstrapping a project is as simple as running a few shell commands:

Install the [Angel CLI](https://github.com/angel-dart/cli):

```bash
pub global activate angel_cli
```

Bootstrap a project:

```bash
angel init hello
```

You can even have your server run and be *hot-reloaded* on file changes:

```bash
dart --observe bin/dev.dart
```

Next, check out the [detailed documentation](https://angel-dart.gitbook.io/angel) to learn to flesh out your project.
